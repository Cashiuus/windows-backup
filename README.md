Backup Windows
==============



Backup script I wrote to accomplish the following:
- Copy individual important files to a cloud destination that is on my local system (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
- Copy a full list of files/dirs to a zip file archive saved to same cloud destination
- Also, copy some files from a connected USB drive as part of this backup (say, if you keep PW database on it)
- Ability to prune out old zip archives with preferences in config on if we delete and how many to keep



If you set this up as a Scheduled Task, you can have it run every night and always have your most important files sync'ed to the cloud
